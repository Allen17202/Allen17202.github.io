							<h1 class="major">Souls-Like Combat System</h1>

							<p>After putting way too many hours into Lies of P and Elden Ring, I decided to try implementing a combat system that emulates the mechanics from those games.
								 Current functionality includes: directional dodge, hit detection system, ragdoll character death, health system, stat system for weapons and armor, player state manager, implementation of
								 attack combos and combat resetting, and Pick up actors for different weapons
							</p>

							<p> The player is able to equip and unequip the weapon, as well as attack. The animations keep track of when the player can combo or reset by using animation notifys.

							<p>Player is able to utilize the pickup actor to add a new weapon. The Hit detection system uses a multi sphere trace by objects as well as start and end sockets that are a part of a basic weapon blueprint that all weapons inherit from
								that define start and end locations for the hit detection for the weapon
							</p>


							<p>Bugs Currently Working On: When attacking with great sword the player floats above the ground a bit, and implementing dual weaponry
							</p>


							<p>Assets Used: Weapon Pack(included the weapons and some animations), Great Sword Animation Pack, Monster Animation Pack, Kraken and Ice Giant Asset Pack, Paragon Character Packs(for the armor and some of the weapons)
