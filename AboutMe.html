						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>My fascination with gaming ignited at the tender age of eight when I immersed myself in my first Pokémon game. The intricacies of strategizing team formations and exploiting type advantages in battles captivated me, and completing my Pokédex filled me with an immense sense of achievement. Over the years, my gaming journey expanded to encompass a diverse range of titles like Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, Overwatch, and Sly Cooper.</p>

						<p>
						However, it wasn't until I reached the end of high school that I recognized my profound passion for gaming could potentially lead to a career in game development. I embarked on a journey of learning Unity, C, and C#. As I began my studies at the University of Central Florida for my undergraduate degree, I took a definitive step by majoring in Computer Science with the ultimate ambition of becoming a game programmer. Throughout my undergraduate years, I delved into various subjects such as computer architecture, computer security, data structures and algorithms, discrete math, vector math, and functional programming. While my demanding course load limited my involvement in gaming projects, I managed to create small games in Unity by following online tutorials.
					</p>
					<p>
					By the time I entered my junior year, I realized that I craved a deeper immersion in the gaming industry. This realization prompted me to pursue a master's program in Game Development, believing it would be the key to unlocking the industry's doors. Opting for a master's program allowed me to focus entirely on a rigorous game development-oriented curriculum. The Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA) emerged as the perfect choice to nurture my aspirations. During my time at FIEA, I collaborated with diverse teams comprising professionals from various fields, including artists, designers, producers, and project managers. This experience taught me vital skills like rapid game prototyping, effective collaboration within sizable teams, and a mastery of C++ programming.
					</p>

					<p>
					Before joining FIEA, I had no prior experience with C++ as a language. However, as I approach the conclusion of the program, I find myself well-versed in a plethora of advanced topics. These include but are not limited to virtual functions, templates, passing by reference and value, dynamic dispatching, as well as diverse design patterns.
						I share all of this to emphasize my unwavering passion for gaming, and to convey my readiness to embark on the journey of creating a game that will capture the hearts of players. I'm eager to dive in and bring to life an experience that resonates deeply with the gaming community.
					</p>

					<p>
						I share this journey to emphasize my unwavering dedication to gaming with you. I'm enthusiastic about plunging into this endeavor and breathing life into an experience that profoundly connects with the gaming community.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Games that I have been playing Recently:</strong> Stray Gods, Bramble: The Mountain King, and Hogwarts Legacy.
