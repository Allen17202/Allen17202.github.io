								 	<h1> Howdy, Folks! </h1>
							<p> <br> My name is Gregory Allen. I am a Gameplay Programmer based in Orlando, Florida. My fascination with gaming began at eight with Pok√©mon, evolving into a diverse gaming journey including titles like Resident Evil and Final Fantasy. Recognizing gaming's potential, I pursued a Computer Science degree, learning Unity, C, and C#. Despite a demanding course load, I crafted small games and realized my calling lay in game development.</br>
								 <br> Entering a master's program at FIEA, I immersed myself in a game development-focused curriculum, mastering C++, Unreal, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. This journey solidified my passion for creating immersive gaming experiences, and I'm now poised to embark on a career in game development, eager to captivate players with innovative and captivating games.</br>

									<h2>Souls-Like Combat System</h2>
									<p>Currently engineering the logic and implementing a third-person combat system inspired by the "Souls-like" genre inspired by games such as Lies of P, simulating the game's combat dynamics. I am actively working towards creating a seamless integration of the combat system, emphasizing fluidity and responsiveness in player actions, as well as modularity in player interactions, attacks, and reactions.
											I utilize C++ and Unreal Engine to code and optimize the combat mechanics, focusing on precise hitboxes, enemy AI behaviors, and player attack feedback.
											Additionally, I created comments detailing the intricacies of the Souls-like combat system, facilitating ease of understanding.

									<h2>Third Person Climbing System</h2>
									<p>
Currently, I am developing and implementing a third-person climbing system using C++ in Unreal Engine, aiming to enhance player interaction possibilities. I have integrated an animation pack for climbing animations and am actively working on integrating these animations with my climbing system within the testing environment.

I utilized C++ and Unreal Engine to code and optimize the climbing system, ensuring smooth and responsive player controls. Concurrently, I am conducting testing and debugging to identify and resolve issues related to the climbing mechanics and their integration with animation blueprints.

Additionally, I am documenting the climbing system's functionalities to facilitate ease of use and understanding for future reference.</p>

									<h2>FIEA Game Engine</h2>
									<p>The journey of bringing to life a game engine was a testament to my unwavering commitment, with every line of code, every late-night session, encapsulating my passion, effort, and determination. As I delved into this ambitious undertaking, I encountered an intricate web of challenges that spanned from design patterns to the creation of user-defined structures, each challenge a step towards shaping my masterpiece. <br> <br>

One of the pivotal hurdles was deciding on the appropriate design patterns to structure the engine's architecture. The weight of this decision was palpable, as it would determine the engine's scalability, maintainability, and overall elegance. I grappled with the intricacies of Singleton, Factory, and Component patterns, among others, as I sought to create a foundation that would seamlessly accommodate the complexities of game development.</p>

									<h2>Jello Jump</h2>
									<p>In a swift span of just two weeks, a nimble team composed of two programmers, a tech designer, and a 3D artist collaboratively brought to life a rapid prototype. This endeavor gave birth to a captivating game centered around a character named Blobo. The core objective of this delightful gameplay is to guide Blobo on a journey where he collects stars and ascends by bouncing on jello platforms. These bouncy platforms, characterized by vibrant shades of green, offer a helping hand to Blobo by refilling his jello meter and bolstering his health. However, a strategic element comes into play, as players must exercise caution and avoid excessive contact with the red jello platforms. Interaction with these red platforms gradually depletes Blobo's jello meter, adding an element of challenge and decision-making.

The synergy of the development team's diverse skills and talents enabled the rapid creation of this engaging prototype. The result is a dynamic and engaging gaming experience that not only showcases the team's ingenuity but also offers players an exciting and strategic gameplay encounter. With a whimsical character, a unique bouncing mechanic, and a balance between risk and reward, the prototype showcases the potential for further expansion and refinement into a full-fledged game.</p>

									<h2>Space Invaders</h2>
									<p>My childhood memories are interwoven with the vibrant lights and electronic symphonies of my great grandfather's retro arcade. Those nostalgic summers saw me entranced, my eyes glued to the screen, as I maneuvered the pixelated spaceship in the iconic game, "Space Invaders." Fast forward to the present, and my decision to embark on a journey of nostalgia led me to recreate this classic gem using the combination of C++ and SFML.</p>
