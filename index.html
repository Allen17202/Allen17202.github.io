							<h1> Howdy!</h1>
							<p>My name is Gregory Allen. I am game programmer from Orlando, Florida with an interest in Gameplay and AI programming.
						     I'm currently enrolled as a graduate student in the Interactive Entertainment Master's program at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, which is part of the University of Central Florida.

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>My fascination with gaming ignited at the tender age of eight when I immersed myself in my first Pokémon game. The intricacies of strategizing team formations and exploiting type advantages in battles captivated me, and completing my Pokédex filled me with an immense sense of achievement. Over the years, my gaming journey expanded to encompass a diverse range of titles like Resident Evil, Final Fantasy, Overwatch, and Sly Cooper.</p>

							<p>
							However, it wasn't until I reached the end of high school that I recognized my profound passion for gaming could potentially lead to a career in game development. I embarked on a journey of learning Unity, C, and C#. As I began my studies at the University of Central Florida for my undergraduate degree, I took a definitive step by majoring in Computer Science with the ultimate ambition of becoming a game programmer. Throughout my undergraduate years, I delved into various subjects such as computer architecture, computer security, data structures and algorithms, discrete math, vector math, and functional programming. While my demanding course load limited my involvement in gaming projects, I managed to create small games in Unity by following online tutorials.
						</p>
						<p>
						By the time I entered my junior year, I realized that I craved a deeper immersion in the gaming industry. This realization prompted me to pursue a master's program in Game Development, believing it would be the key to unlocking the industry's doors. Opting for a master's program allowed me to focus entirely on a rigorous game development-oriented curriculum. The Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA) emerged as the perfect choice to nurture my aspirations. During my tenure at FIEA, I collaborated with diverse teams comprising professionals from various fields, including artists, designers, producers, and project managers. This experience enriched me with vital skills like rapid game prototyping, effective collaboration within sizable teams of up to 27 members, and mastery of C++ programming.
						</p>

						<p>
						Before joining FIEA, I had no prior experience with C++ coding. However, as I approach the conclusion of the program, I find myself well-versed in a plethora of advanced topics. These encompass virtual functions, templates, passing by reference and value, dynamic dispatching, as well as diverse design patterns and much more.
							I share all of this to emphasize my unwavering passion for gaming, and to convey my readiness to embark on the journey of creating a game that will capture the hearts of players. I'm eager to dive in and bring to life an experience that resonates deeply with the gaming community.
						</p>

						<p>
							I share this journey to underscore my unwavering dedication to gaming and to express my readiness to embark on the quest of creating a game that resonates deeply with players. I'm enthusiastic about plunging into this endeavor and breathing life into an experience that profoundly connects with the gaming community.
						</p>

						<p>
							<strong>Games that I have been playing Recently:</strong> Stray Gods, Bramble: The Mountain King, and Hogwarts Legacy.

									<h2>FIEA Game Engine</h2>
									<p>The journey of bringing to life a game engine was a testament to my unwavering commitment, with every line of code, every late-night session, encapsulating my passion, effort, and determination. As I delved into this ambitious undertaking, I encountered an intricate web of challenges that spanned from design patterns to the creation of user-defined structures, each challenge a step towards shaping my masterpiece. <br> <br>

One of the pivotal hurdles was deciding on the appropriate design patterns to structure the engine's architecture. The weight of this decision was palpable, as it would determine the engine's scalability, maintainability, and overall elegance. I grappled with the intricacies of Singleton, Factory, and Component patterns, among others, as I sought to create a foundation that would seamlessly accommodate the complexities of game development.</p>

									<h2>Butterfree Ambush</h2>
									<p>If someone had told me that I'd be crafting a game in 68K assembly, I would have dismissed it as an improbable notion. Yet, here I am, proudly sharing the story of "Butterfree Ambush," a game that sprang to life as my very own interpretation of the beloved Flappy Bird concept, coded entirely in assembly. <br><br>

The spark for this endeavor ignited when I decided to challenge my programming skills in an unconventional way. I drew inspiration from the addictive simplicity of "Flappy Bird" and set my sights on creating a unique rendition that embraced the quirks of assembly language.</p>

									<h2>Space Invaders</h2>
									<p>My childhood memories are interwoven with the vibrant lights and electronic symphonies of my great grandfather's retro arcade. Those nostalgic summers saw me entranced, my eyes glued to the screen, as I maneuvered the pixelated spaceship in the iconic game, "Space Invaders." Fast forward to the present, and my decision to embark on a journey of nostalgia led me to recreate this classic gem using the combination of C++ and SFML.</p>
