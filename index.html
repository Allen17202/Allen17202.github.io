									<h2>FIEA Game Engine</h2>
									<p>The journey of bringing to life a game engine was a testament to my unwavering commitment, with every line of code, every late-night session, encapsulating my passion, effort, and determination. As I delved into this ambitious undertaking, I encountered an intricate web of challenges that spanned from design patterns to the creation of user-defined structures, each challenge a step towards shaping my masterpiece. <br> <br>

One of the pivotal hurdles was deciding on the appropriate design patterns to structure the engine's architecture. The weight of this decision was palpable, as it would determine the engine's scalability, maintainability, and overall elegance. I grappled with the intricacies of Singleton, Factory, and Component patterns, among others, as I sought to create a foundation that would seamlessly accommodate the complexities of game development.</p>

									<h2>Jello Jump</h2>
									<p>In a swift span of just two weeks, a nimble team composed of two programmers, a tech designer, and a 3D artist collaboratively brought to life a rapid prototype. This endeavor gave birth to a captivating game centered around a character named Blobo. The core objective of this delightful gameplay is to guide Blobo on a journey where he collects stars and ascends by bouncing on jello platforms. These bouncy platforms, characterized by vibrant shades of green, offer a helping hand to Blobo by refilling his jello meter and bolstering his health. However, a strategic element comes into play, as players must exercise caution and avoid excessive contact with the red jello platforms. Interaction with these red platforms gradually depletes Blobo's jello meter, adding an element of challenge and decision-making.

The synergy of the development team's diverse skills and talents enabled the rapid creation of this engaging prototype. The result is a dynamic and engaging gaming experience that not only showcases the team's ingenuity but also offers players an exciting and strategic gameplay encounter. With a whimsical character, a unique bouncing mechanic, and a balance between risk and reward, the prototype showcases the potential for further expansion and refinement into a full-fledged game.</p>
